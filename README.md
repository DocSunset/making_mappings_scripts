# Making Mappings: Analysis Scripts

This repository is part of [the online appendix to the "Making Mappings" series
of publications by Travis West and colleagues](traviswest.ca/making_mappings).
Herein you will find the python scripts used in studies to generate graphs and
figures from the user activity data. A brief description of each script can be
found in the full appendix, alongside examples of their output. For links to
the research, access to the full dataset that these scripts operate on, and all
other questions, please see the full appendix here:
traviswest.ca/making_mappings

If you wish to test the scripts yourself and have any difficulties getting them
to run, please open an issue and I would be happy to assist you. Documentation
is still lacking on necessary set up, dependencies, and so on, which is my own
fault, so I take responsibility for helping you to overcome any challenges you
face when trying to use these scripts at this time.
